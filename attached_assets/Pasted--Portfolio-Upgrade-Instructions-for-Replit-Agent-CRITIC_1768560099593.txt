### Technical Implementation Requirements

**Google AI (Gemini) Integration:**

**Security - CRITICAL:**
- Store API key in Replit Secrets as environment variable (name it `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- NEVER put the API key in frontend JavaScript
- NEVER commit API key to code
- Create a backend API endpoint to handle chatbot requests

**Backend Architecture:**
- Create a server-side endpoint (e.g., `/api/chat`)
- Frontend sends user messages to this endpoint
- Backend endpoint calls Google Gemini API with the API key from environment
- Backend returns AI response to frontend
- This keeps the API key secure

**API Details:**
- Use Google Gemini API endpoint
- Model: gemini-pro
- Include the chatbot persona and context in the system prompt
- Limit response tokens to keep answers brief (around 150-200 tokens)
- Handle errors gracefully

**Frontend Behavior:**
- Store conversation history in JavaScript variables (NOT localStorage)
- Send conversation context with each request for continuity
- Show loading/typing indicator while waiting for response
- Handle errors with user-friendly messages like "Sorry, I couldn't process that. Try again?"
- Auto-scroll to newest message
- Clear conversation option (optional)

**Performance:**
- Implement basic rate limiting (prevent spam clicking)
- Add debouncing to send button
- Cache common responses if possible
- Optimize animations for mobile

## Task 5: Framer-Style Animation Enhancements

**PRESERVE EXISTING ANIMATIONS** - only add these new ones:

### Add Scroll-Triggered Animations

**For glass panels and sections:**
- Implement intersection observer to detect when elements enter viewport
- When element is 10-20% visible, trigger fade-in and slide-up animation
- Animation should be smooth (0.6-0.8 seconds)
- Use ease-out timing function
- Elements should start slightly below their final position and fade in

**For project cards:**
- Stagger animation (each card animates slightly after the previous one)
- Faster animation duration (0.4-0.5 seconds)

### Enhanced Hover Effects

**For project cards:**
- Add subtle 3D tilt effect on mouse movement (card tilts slightly toward cursor)
- Increase current lift effect slightly
- Add smooth transition

**For buttons:**
- Add subtle scale effect (1.02-1.05) on hover
- Smooth transition

**For glass panels:**
- Very subtle scale or glow effect on hover (optional, keep minimal)

### Micro-interactions

**For contact buttons:**
- Add ripple effect on click (optional)
- Magnetic cursor effect (button slightly moves toward cursor when hovering nearby)

**For filter buttons:**
- Smooth color transition on activation
- Subtle bounce or scale animation on click

### Loading Animations

**On page load:**
- Hero section fades in first
- Then other sections fade in with slight stagger
- Smooth and professional (nothing too flashy)

**Important:** All animations must be performant (60fps), work smoothly on mobile, and respect user's motion preferences

## Task 6: Optional React Conversion

**Consider converting to React IF it provides benefits:**

**Benefits of React version:**
- Better component organization
- Easier state management for chatbot
- More maintainable code
- Better performance for animations
- Easier to add future features

**Requirements if converting to React:**
- Maintain EXACT same visual appearance
- All current functionality must work identically
- Use React hooks for state management
- Use Tailwind CSS or styled-components (keep current styling)
- Ensure all animations work the same
- Mobile responsiveness must be identical
- Theme switching must work the same way

**Components to create:**
- Header component
- HelloSection component
- ProjectCard component
- ExperienceItem component
- Chatbot component
- FilterButtons component
- etc.

**Decision:** Only convert to React if you're confident it won't break anything and will make maintenance easier. HTML version is fine if it works well.
