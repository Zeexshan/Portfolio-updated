### Hero Section Transformation

**Current:** Basic title and video
**Upgrade to:**

**Desktop Experience:**
- Large, bold typography with the PORTFOLIO title
- Implement **parallax scrolling** - background moves slower than foreground
- Add **3D background element** using Three.js:
  - Floating geometric shapes (spheres, toruses, abstract forms)
  - Subtle rotation and movement
  - Particles or grid system that reacts to scroll
  - Glowing orange accents on shapes
  - Depth and atmosphere
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations

- **Magnetic cursor effect** - cursor becomes larger and interactive near buttons/links

**Mobile Experience:**
- Simplified 3D (or remove if performance issues)
- Focus on smooth scroll animations
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Reduce motion if user prefers

### Project Gallery - Make it INCREDIBLE

**Desktop Projects Display:**

Replace basic grid with **immersive project showcase**:

**Option A: Horizontal Scroll Gallery**
- Full-width horizontal scrolling section
- Large project cards (600px+ wide)
- Smooth momentum scrolling
- Cards have depth with layered shadows
- Hover reveals more info with smooth transitions
- Parallax effect between card layers
- Progress indicator showing scroll position

**Option B: 3D Card Stack**
- Projects stacked in 3D space
- Scroll to navigate through stack
- Active card comes forward, others fade back
- Smooth 3D transforms
- Touch/drag to navigate on mobile

**Option C: Bento Grid with Hover Effects**
- Asymmetric grid layout (different sized cards)
- Larger cards for featured projects
- On hover: card lifts up, reveals video/gif preview
- Smooth color transitions
- Project details slide in from bottom

**Choose the best option that:**
- Works smoothly on mobile
- Showcases projects beautifully
- Feels premium and interactive
- Doesn't sacrifice usability for style

**For each project card:**
- Add subtle 3D tilt on mouse movement (desktop only)
- Smooth hover transitions (0.4-0.6s)
- Image/video preview on hover
- Gradient overlays
- Clean typography
- Call-to-action button ("View Project", "Live Site")
- Tech stack badges with icons

**Mobile Project Cards:**
- NO hover effects (they don't work on touch)
- Instead use: tap to expand, swipe gestures
- Full card content visible by default
- Smooth scroll animations as cards enter view
- Fast, responsive interactions

### Advanced Scroll Animations

**Implement sophisticated scroll-triggered animations:**

**Scroll-Linked Animations:**
- Elements fade and slide in as you scroll
- Stagger effect (items appear one after another)
- Counter animations for numbers (1.2K subscribers counts up)
- Progress bars fill on scroll
- Images zoom or reveal on scroll

**Parallax Sections:**
- Background layers move at different speeds
- Creates depth and dimension
- Text and images separate on scroll
- Smooth, butter-like motion

**Horizontal Scroll Sections:**
- Some sections scroll horizontally while page scrolls vertically
- Great for timeline or project showcase
- Smooth snap points

**Scroll-Jacking (Use Sparingly):**
- Smooth snap between sections
- Full-screen sections with controlled scroll
- Only if it enhances UX, not hinders it

### Micro-Interactions & Details

**Cursor Effects:**
- Custom cursor that changes based on context
- Enlarges over clickable elements
- Glows orange over interactive areas
- Trail effect or particle following cursor
- Smooth, organic movement

**Button Interactions:**
- Magnetic effect (button pulls toward cursor)
- Ripple effect on click
- Smooth scale and color transitions
- Haptic-like feedback (visual bounce)

**Loading Experience:**
- Beautiful loading animation on page load
- Percentage counter
- Smooth fade-in to content
- Not too long (1-2 seconds max)

**Text Animations:**

- Gradient text effects
- Text that morphs or shifts
- Highlight animations

**Sound Effects (Optional):**
- Subtle hover sounds
- Click feedback sounds
- Toggle on/off option
- Very minimal and professional

### 3D Elements Integration

**Use Three.js for premium 3D effects:**

**Background 3D Scene:**
- Abstract geometric shapes floating
- Subtle animation (rotation, floating)
- Reacts to scroll position
- Responds to mouse movement
- Orange glow/emission on shapes
- Dark or gradient background
- Particles or grid system
- NOT overwhelming - enhances, doesn't distract

**3D Project Previews (Advanced):**
- 3D mockups of websites
- Laptop/phone mockups showing projects
- Interactive rotation on mouse move
- Can source free 3D models from:
  - Sketchfab (free models)
  - Poly Pizza
  - Three.js examples
  - Create simple shapes programmatically

**Performance Critical:**
- Optimize 3D models (low poly count)
- Reduce quality on mobile or remove entirely
- Use LOD (Level of Detail) if needed
- Monitor frame rate (must maintain 60fps)
- Lazy load 3D elements

### Mobile-First Considerations

**Mobile Must Be Perfect:**
- Touch gestures instead of hover

- Tap to expand/reveal
- Simplified 3D or none at all
- Fast loading (optimize images/videos)
- Smooth 60fps scrolling
- Large touch targets (44px minimum)
- Readable text sizes
- No horizontal scroll (unless intentional)
- Works on slow connections

**Performance Budget:**

- First Contentful Paint under 1.5s
- Interactive in under 2.5s
- Smooth animations (no jank)
- Optimized images (WebP format)
- Lazy loading for below-fold content

### Color & Visual Refinement

- Subtle color shifts on scroll
- Gradient overlays on images
- Glowing effects on interactive elements
- Gradient text (orange to lighter shade)
- Color transitions on hover

**Lighting & Shadows:**

- Proper hierarchy (clear visual levels)
- Line height and spacing perfection
- Animated text reveals
- Gradient text for headings
- Text shadows for depth
- Perfect readability

### Accessibility & UX
